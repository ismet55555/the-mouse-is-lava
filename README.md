> Don't you touch the mouse... IT'S LAVA!!

If you are trying to not use your mouse, this little program is for you! This program is aimed to help you use your mouse less by sending you a anoying system notification every time you move your mouse. 

## Try it

1. Ensure `go` version 1.17 or higher is installed
    - `go version`
    - If not, install it.

2. Build the project
    - `go build`
    - Note: Might need to install build dependencies: https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo#requirements

3. Run it
    - `./mouse-lava`

4. Once you are tired of it end with `CTRL-c`


## Notes

- Obviously system notification must be turned on / unmuted to recieve notifications
- MacOS users may have to give the terminal application access
    - System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
    - Unlock on bottom left corner
    - Check terminal application you are running this from
